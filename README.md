PYSKL is a toolbox focusing on action recognition based on **SK**e**L**eton data with **PY**Torch. Various algorithms will be supported for skeleton-based action recognition. We build this project based on the OpenSource Project [MMAction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2).

This repo is the official implementation of [PoseConv3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13586) and [STGCN++](https://github.com/kennymckormick/pyskl/tree/main/configs/stgcn%2B%2B).

## Contributing

PYSKL is an OpenSource Project under the Apache2 license. Any contribution from the community to improve PYSKL is appreciated. For **significant** contributions (like supporting a novel & important task), a corresponding part will be added to our updated tech report, while the contributor will also be added to the author list.

Any user can open a PR to contribute to PYSKL. The PR will be reviewed before being merged into the master branch. If you want to open a **large** PR in PYSKL, you are recommended to first reach me (via my email dhd.efz@gmail.com) to discuss the design, which helps to save large amounts of time in the reviewing stage.

## News

- The [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09443) of PYSKL is accepted by MM 2022 (**2022-06-28**).
- Support spatial augmentations and provide a benchmark on ST-GCN++  (**2022-05-12**).
- Support skeleton action recognition demo with GCN algorithms  (**2022-05-03**).
- Release the skeleton annotations (HRNet 2D Pose), config files, and pre-trained ckpts for Kinetics-400. K400 is a large-scale dataset (even for skeleton), you should have `memcached` and `pymemcache` installed for efficient training & testing on K400 (**2022-05-01**).
- Provide an example (diving48) for processing a custom video dataset, generating 2D skeleton annotations, and using PoseC3D for skeleton-based action recognition. The tutorial for skeleton extraction part is available in [diving48_example](/examples/extract_diving48_skeleton/diving48_example.ipynb)  (**2022-04-15**).

For data pre-processing, we estimate 2D skeletons with a two-stage pose estimator (Faster-RCNN + HRNet). For 3D skeletons, we follow the pre-processing procedure of [CTR-GCN](https://github.com/Uason-Chen/CTR-GCN). Currently, we do not provide the pre-processing scripts. Instead, we directly provide the processed skeleton data as pickle files ([download links here](/tools/data/README.md)), which can be directly used in training and evaluation.  You can use [vis_skeleton](/demo/vis_skeleton.ipynb) to visualize the provided skeleton data.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kennymckormick/pyskl.git
cd pyskl
# Please first install pytorch according to instructions on the official website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. Please use pytorch with version smaller than 1.11.0 and larger (or equal) than 1.5.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Demonstration

```shell
# Before running the demo, make sure you have installed mmcv-full, mmpose and mmdet. You should first install mmcv-full, and then install mmpose, mmdet.
# You should run the following scripts under the directory `$PYSKL`
# Running the demo with PoseC3D trained on NTURGB+D 120 (Joint Modality), which is the default option. The input file is demo/ntu_sample.avi, the output file is demo/demo.mp4
python demo/demo_skeleton.py demo/ntu_sample.avi demo/demo.mp4
# Running the demo with STGCN++ trained on NTURGB+D 120 (Joint Modality). The input file is demo/ntu_sample.avi, the output file is demo/demo.mp4
python demo/demo_skeleton.py demo/ntu_sample.avi demo/demo.mp4 --config configs/stgcn++/stgcn++_ntu120_xsub_hrnet/j.py --checkpoint http://download.openmmlab.com/mmaction/pyskl/ckpt/stgcnpp/stgcnpp_ntu120_xsub_hrnet/j.pth
```

Note that for running demo on an arbitrary input video, you need a tracker to formulate pose estimation results for each frame into multiple skeleton sequences. Currently we are using a [naive tracker](https://github.com/kennymckormick/pyskl/blob/4ddb7ac384e231694fd2b4b7774144e5762862ab/demo/demo_skeleton.py#L192) based on inter-frame pose similarities. You can also try to write your own tracker.

## Training & Testing

You can use following commands for training and testing. Basically, we support distributed training on a single server with multiple GPUs.
```shell
# Training
bash tools/dist_train.sh {config_name} {num_gpus} {other_options}
# Testing
bash tools/dist_test.sh {config_name} {checkpoint} {num_gpus} --out {output_file} --eval top_k_accuracy mean_class_accuracy
```
For specific examples, please go to the README for each specific algorithm we supported.
